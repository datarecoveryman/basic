Various implementations of old BASIC, e.g.
10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"
20 GOTO 10

Done in Python, Haskell, C++, or whatever else I can manage.

Reading from Wikipedia, I think Tiny BASIC is a good target:
"Tiny BASIC dialects generally lacked a variety of features commonly found in other dialects, for instance, most versions lacked string variables, lacked floating-point math, and allowed only single-letter variable names."
