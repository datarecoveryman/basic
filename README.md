Various implementations of old BASIC, e.g.

> `10 PRINT "HELLO WORLD"`
> `20 GOTO 10`

Done in Python, Haskell, C++, or whatever else I can manage.

Reading from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiny_BASIC), I think Tiny BASIC is a good target:
"Tiny BASIC dialects generally lacked a variety of features commonly found in other dialects, for instance, most versions lacked string variables, lacked floating-point math, and allowed only single-letter variable names."

TODO:
* Automated tests, only noisy on error.
* Expand Python version (if/then, while)
* PHP version: finish REPL?
* Haskell version
